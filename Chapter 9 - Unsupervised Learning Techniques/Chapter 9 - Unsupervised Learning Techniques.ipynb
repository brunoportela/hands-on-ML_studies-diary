    "- Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to group similar instances together into clusters. Clustering is a great tool for data analysis, customer segmentation, recommender systems, search engines, image segmentation, semi-supervised learning, dimensionality reduction, and more.\n",
    "- Anomaly detection\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to learn what “normal” data looks like, and then use that to detect abnormal instances, such as defective items on a production line or a new trend in a time series.\n",
    "- Density estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the task of estimating the probability density function (PDF) of the random process that generated the dataset. Density estimation is commonly used for anomaly detection: instances located in very low-density regions are likely to be anomalies. It is also useful for data analysis and visualization."

    "\"For example, consider a node containing four instances of class A and one of class B. Its Gini impurity is $1 – (1/5)^2 – (4/5)^2 = 0.32$. Now suppose the dataset is one-dimensional and the instances are lined up in the following order: A, B, A, A, A. You can verify that the algorithm will split this node after the second instance, producing one child node with instances A, B, and the other child node with instances A, A, A. The first child node’s Gini impurity is $1 – (1/2)^2 – (1/2)^2 = 0.5$, which is higher than its parent’s. This is compensated for by the fact that the other node is pure, so its overall weighted Gini impurity is 2/5 × 0.5 + 3/5 × 0 = 0.2, which is lower than the parent’s Gini impurity.\"\n"

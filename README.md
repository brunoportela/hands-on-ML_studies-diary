# hands-on-ML_studies-diary

In this repository, I will register my progress while studying with the 
"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow, 2nd Edition" book, by Aurélien Géron.

I will create folders for each chapter with my notes, exercises resolutions and relevant material.

By using this approach, I can keep myself engaged, keep track of my progress and I can easily refer back and review previous concepts.
